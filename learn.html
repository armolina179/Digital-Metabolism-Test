        <p>
        Digital metabolism, or digital-environmental metabolism, refers to the idea that the digital technologies we use—like phones, computers, and the internet—are not isolated from the physical world. Instead, they are part of a larger system of exchanges that resemble the way living organisms process energy and materials to sustain themselves. <br><br>
        
        Think of it this way: when you scroll through social media or watch a video online, that activity is supported by physical infrastructures like data centers, wires, and servers, which consume energy and generate waste. These systems are "fed" by resources from the earth, like metals for building devices and energy to power them, and they create "waste," such as electronic waste and carbon emissions.<br><br>
        
        The term highlights how deeply interconnected our digital lives are with natural systems, human labor, and the planet’s ecosystems. It suggests that just as our bodies depend on food and air to survive, the digital world depends on resources from the earth—and has an impact on it in return. Recognizing this connection can help us rethink digital practices in ways that are more environmentally aware and sustainable. </p>

        <h2>What is the digital metabolism test?</h2>
        <p>This interactive test reveals the invisible connections between digital technology and the geophysical, human, and cultural systems that shape its creation, use, and disposal. By mapping the journey of technology — from its origins in mined materials to its cultural and infrastructural roles — this test invites you to reflect on your place within the digital ecosystem. </p>

        <h2>What is "The Grid?"</h2>
        <p>The grid is a framework that connects the physical and digital worlds. It encompasses the infrastructure — wires, data centers, and devices — that powers our digital lives, as well as the cultural and social systems shaped by media and technology. Positioned at the intersection of origins and waste, and culture and infrastructure, the grid reveals how deeply intertwined our technological and environmental systems truly are.</p>
