            <h3>A: Origins</h3>
            <p>
                Your digital devices begin their lives deep within the earth, extracted as raw materials like metals and minerals. These resources are mined in ways that often have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and communities. By engaging with technology, you are connected to these origins—whether through the energy used to power your devices or the global supply chains that deliver them into your hands.
            </p>
            <h3>B: Data</h3>
            <p>
                Data exists not just as an abstract cloud but as a tangible flow of information stored and processed through vast infrastructures like data centers, cables, and transfer stations. Every interaction you have online relies on these systems, which consume significant energy and resources. Your use of technology places you within this network of constant data production and exchange.
            </p>
            <h3>C: Waste</h3>
            <p>
                When digital devices are discarded, they don’t simply vanish—they become electronic waste, much of which is poorly recycled or left to accumulate in landfills. This waste impacts the environment and human health, particularly in regions tasked with its disposal. Each upgrade or replacement contributes to this lifecycle, tying you to the afterlives of the technology you use.
            </p>
            <h3>D: Media</h3>
            <p>
                From social platforms to streaming services, media is the cultural layer of the digital grid. It shapes how we communicate, learn, and consume, while also influencing the physical and technical structures that make it possible. By participating in these media ecosystems, you contribute to a cycle of creation, distribution, and consumption that defines the digital age.

        <h3>Reflect on Your Digital Metabolism</h3>
        <p>
            Inspired by the principles of <i>permaculture</i>, your digital metabolism can become a model for care—care for the earth, care for people, and care for sharing resources fairly. As you consider the journey of your digital devices and data, think about how you can build more regenerative relationships with the technologies you rely on.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earth Care:</strong> Reduce the strain on natural resources by extending the life of your devices, choosing sustainable options, and disposing of electronics responsibly.</li>
            <li><strong>People Care:</strong> Acknowledge the human labor behind your technologies. Support companies that prioritize ethical practices, and advocate for transparency in tech production and recycling.</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Share:</strong> Embrace digital minimalism where possible—consume media thoughtfully, share resources equitably, and resist cycles of overconsumption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By embedding these ethics into your digital practices, you can transform your habits into actions that regenerate rather than deplete. Together, we can imagine a digital future that nurtures both humanity and the planet.
